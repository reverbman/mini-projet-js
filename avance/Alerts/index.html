        Build a component that shows a toast (notification) with animation on button click.
        Each toast can have its own message and type (default or error).
        Toasts should hide automatically after 1.5 seconds.
        If toast is hovered by mouse - timer should reset and start over again when cursor leaves toast.
        While one toast is active showing other toasts should be blocked.
